This is a pure Python implementation of equivalence sets, partitions of
objects that maintain the equivalence relation properties (reflexivity, symmetry,
transitivity). Two objects are considered equivalent either explicitly, after
being merged, or implicitly, through a key function.

To learn how to use this module, read the docs and see the included unit tests.
