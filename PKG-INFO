Description: The ``Equivalence`` class can be used to maintain a partition of objects
        into equivalence sets, making sure that the equivalence properties (reflexivity,
        symmetry, transitivity) are maintained. Two objects ``x`` and ``y`` are
        considered equivalent either implicitly (through a key function) or explicitly by
        calling ``merge(x,y)``.
